  //
  // tips: a spread factor can be a decimal number (such as 1.5)
  //       a spread factor of 1 means all structure's placements are not modified (useful if you want to use only custom spread factors)
  //       a spread factor above 1 means all structures are rarer
  //       a spread factor below 1 means all structures are more common
  //       a spread factor of 0 disables all structures entirely

  // Some structure mods/datapacks do not specify a custom salt or use the same salt for all their structures, which might cause structure overlap.
  // Enabling this is supposed to reduce this phenomenon, as all structure sets will have their own salt, hashed from their id.
  // If unsure, leave this enabled.
